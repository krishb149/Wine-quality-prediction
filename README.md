# Wine-quality-prediction
We will use ANN(Artifical neural network), a Deep Learning algorithm to evaluate it

Lets have a look at the Input variables:
fixed acidity : non-volatile acids that do not evaporate readily

volatile acidity : are high acetic acid in wine which leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste

citric acid : acts as a preservative, adds freshness and flavor to wines

residual sugar : amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops

chlorides : the amount of salt in the wine

free sulfur dioxide : prevents microbial growth

total sulfur dioxide : amount of free + bound forms of SO2

density : density of wine (affects sweetness)

pH : is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of wine

sulphates : sulphate content

alcohol : alcohol content

quality - quality (score between 0 and 10, Output variable (based on sensory data))
